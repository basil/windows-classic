### Windows Classic Inspired Theme for Linux

This is a theme primarily for LXQt and inspired by Windows 2000, Millennium Edition & Windows XP (Classic Theme).  

At this stage, a theme for LXQt, Openbox & KWin are supplied.  Openbox is the default LXQt Window Manager - it is fast but an exact theme is not possible. KWin is KDE's Plasma WM - it is more accurate, with better special effects, but at the cost of speed. Memory usage shouldn't be an issue due to low requirements for both.

Possible future additions are:

- Icon Theme
- Cursor Theme
- Backport to Win98 & Win95 inspired theme/s
- SDDM (default Display Manager for LXQt) theme
- Plymouth theme (boot splash screen)

This was created as there didn't appear to be a Windows Classic theme for LXQt. Additionally, due to Qt's (cross platform app framework) relatively accurate built-in Windows widget style, it seemed as waste to not take advantage of this. Regardless, it wasn't as easy as first predicted, due to peculiarities in both LXQt and Qt.
