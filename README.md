Windows Classic Inspired Theme for Linux

This is a theme primarily for LXQt inspired by Windows 2000, Melimmium Edition & Windows XP (Classic Theme).

At this stage, a theme for LXQt, Openbox & KWin are supplied.

Possible future additions are:

Icon Theme
Cursor Theme
Backport to Win98 & Win95 inspired theme/s
Other *lightweight* desktop environments (e.g. LXDE, XFCE, etc.)

I decided to make this as I couldn't find a Windows Classic based theme for LXQt, and thought this was a good match due to QT's relatively accurate built-in Windows 9x widget theme.
